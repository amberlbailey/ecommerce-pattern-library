The buttons use mostly our secondary color to contrast from our dark primary color

- The standard buttons are used through most of the website. They are used for the call to action buttons, cards and the navigation.

- The ghost button is used on the banner to stand out from the rest of our standard buttons.

Add different 'font-size' classes for the different sized buttons throughout the site.
